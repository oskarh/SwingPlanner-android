# SwingPlanner
SwingPlanner is an app made for Swing dance lovers. Find your event anywhere in the world, searching by continent, country, city as well as filtering by any type of swing dance. You can also find your favorite dance teacher, find their best moves on YouTube and subscribe to when they register for new events.

## Technical information
The purpose of this app is to try out new ways of doing things technically. It was intended to keep a high code standard, but in order to complete the project sacrifices to the architecture had to be made.

__*Warning*__ Currently there are problems with the backend leading to the app not working correctly. To see what it looks like see the video above.
